# Mini-Scan Configuration
# ================================================

# Property values that use the placeholder syntax `${ ... }` are resolved via environment variables. For examples, on a
# POSIX system, the following variable could be defined in `.bashrc`, `.profile`, `.bash_profile`, or via the command
# line:
#
#   export FOO="bar"
#
# which could then be referenced by value:
#
#   some-application-property: ${FOO}
#
# At runtime, the value for `some-application-property` would be `bar`.
#
# The pipe `|` symbol can be used within a placeholder to specify a default value if an environment variable cannot be
# resolved. For examples:
#
#   required-application-property: ${DOES_NOT_EXIST | baz}
#
# At runtime, the value for `required-application-property` would be `baz` if the environment variable `DOES_NOT_EXIST`
# was not set.
